Looked at was needed to do to setup this up properly. I setup the tests I needed on postman, loaded up the database the application needed and changed the password in the application so it would run the database on my computer. I Wrote down what issues were problems still in the application and planned for what I would do the next time I would work on the project.

picture below is the database used for the application.

 CategoriesDao,CategoriesController, productDao and productConorller are all working correctly now. Started working on the shopping cart. The interface has been fixed to have functions and the shoppingCartDao has the delete function finished along with the shoppingCartController. Will work on adding the other functions tommrow and hopefully have them up and running.
